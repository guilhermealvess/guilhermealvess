## Project Leonidas ⚔️🛡️
```

I'm working on a personal project, I'm calling it Project Leonidas, and yes, it's the Leonidas of the 300 kkk 😁️. 

This project consists of a set of applications that together form a fictitious marketplace and payment methods 📦️ + 💳️. 

The objective of this project is to be a place to practice new languages, architectures and tools, that is, a kind of play ground where 
I can practice skills that I don't normally practice in everyday projects in the work environment, a laboratory 🔬️🔭️.

Not giving up clean and responsible code, with tests, best practices and documentation 👨🏽‍💻️✅️.

This project is totally open to ideas, suggestions and contributions, feel free. 💡️😉️
